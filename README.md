# World-Happiness-Report
Data Analysis project conducted in Python for CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program

## Objective
To conduct initial and exploratory analysis for The World Happiness Report, a publication of data collected via phone and in person survey by the Gallup World Poll. This report reflects a worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and well-being as criteria for government policy. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, and shows how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

Observed data on six life factors and estimates of their associations with life evaluations are used to explain the variation across countries. They include GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and government corruption.

The analysis is to derive insights into Happiness Scores throughout the world and what factors have the biggest impact on that score.
